This project is just a proof of concept to present the SOLID principles as documented on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

  

## Introduction

The responsibility of the this package is provide a way for doing some actions on `WorkDetail` as described in the protocol `WorkPerforming`.

# Complementary section

This consist of helper functions to illustrate the point or to describe the object used `WorkDetail` and a way to create random sample.

# Classic implementation
This is the basic implementation that present everything required to achieve a task and all its related code in one place.

  

# The Solid implementation
This would try to separate the responsibilities and into smaller tasks that only care/know about what is needed to achieve that task.

## Concrete implementation

## Factories

## Wrappers
